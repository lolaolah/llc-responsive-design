    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      ##Getting Set Up

      **[Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com)** - a text editor with colour highlighting and other helpful features. If you are unable to install Sublime Text, try installing: [Notepad++](http://notepad-plus-plus.org/) (Windows), [Atom](https://atom.io/) (Mac) or [Text Wrangler](http://www.barebones.com/products/textwrangler/download.html) (older Macs).

      **[Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/intl/en-CA/chrome/browser/)** - Choose a modern web browser that supports current web standards and has good development tools. 

      To set Chrome as your default browser, follow [these instructions](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95417?hl=en). 

      Firefox, Safari, and IE 10+ are great, but their dev tools are different so stick to Chrome for this class please! Visit [browsehappy.com](http://browsehappy.com) for more info about modern browsers.
    </section>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      ##Chrome Dev Tools

      **Developer tools** allow us to *inspect* any web page to see the code. It also includes a mobile emulator! The tools can be accessed in 3 ways:

      * right-click / two-finger tap on a web page and select **Inspect Element** OR
      * select the menu icon in the top right hand corner of the Chrome browser and select **Tools > Developer Tools** OR
      * keyboard shortcut: **Ctrl + Shift + I** (PC) / **Cmnd + Option + I** (Mac)

      Features are always being added/updated so make sure you're up to date by copying `chrome://chrome/` into your browser address bar.

      Open dev tools. Ensure the little phone is blue to start the emulator!

      <h1>What is <br> Responsive Design?</h1>
    </section>

    <section class="slide">
      <h2>Different types of web design</h2>
      <p>Flexible websites are not at totally new concepts so in order to understand responsive web design and development better, we have to understand what the options are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Fixed</li>
        <li>Fluid</li>
        <li>Adaptive</li>
        <li>Responsive</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
##Fixed Web Design

*   Everything has a set width (eg. 960px). Popular method before mobile browsing became commonplace.
*   On a mobile screen, it is zoomed out to the size of the device making the content really small. 
*   Will need a separate site, usually an "m dot" site to make something mobile friendly :(

Try opening these sites on your phone or resize the browser:  

[toronto.ca](http://toronto.ca)  
[m.facebook.com](https://m.facebook.com/)  
[facebook.com](https://facebook.com)
    </section>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
##Fluid web design
*   Based on percentage widths, each block of content takes up a percentage of the page. (e.g. a sidebar with a width of 30% and main section with a width of ~70%)
*   When you resize the browser, the blocks will resize *relative* to the size of the page (aka the "viewport").
*   Not optimized for smaller screens & mobile devices.

Example: [http://alistapart.com/d/responsive-web-design/ex/ex-site-flexible.html](http://alistapart.com/d/responsive-web-design/ex/ex-site-flexible.html)

[Full article here](http://alistapart.com/article/responsive-web-design). Also, the article that started the Responsive Design movement.
    </section>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
## Adaptive web design

*   Uses a series of fixed layouts.
*   Uses _media queries_ to target specific viewport sizes (more on this later).
*   The content itself changes.
*   Best to think of it as a _set_ of fixed layouts that are invoked in response to the device size.

Example: [goo.gl/lUyNrZ](http://goo.gl/lUyNrZ)
    </section>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      ## And finally...responsive web design!

*   Uses a fluid grid layout.
*   Unlike fluid designs, it _also_ uses media queries to change the look and feel depending on device size.
*   Page components are **flexible** in between common device sizes and designed with **breakpoints** to present content in the most suitable way for common device sizes.
*   Can keep content layout similar and/or move/hide content.

Example: [goo.gl/JNfJ5X](http://goo.gl/JNfJ5X)

What do you notice about the changing layout?

      <blockquote>"When you lose 80% of your screen real estate, all the extraneous bloat that tends to finds its way onto large screen designs doesn’t seem so attractive or necessary anymore. Mobile provides a great opportunity to reevaluate what content/functionality is necessary and gives us an opportunity to strip away the cruft across the board (and not just for mobile users either). These constraints also encourage ease-of-use, intuitiveness and speed as essential ingredients to a good user experience."

      <h1>Crash Course in HTML</h1>
    </section>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
## HTML Overview / Review

HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is used to wrap the contents and assign meaning to parts of your web document using **tags** to create HTML **elements**. HTML5 is the latest version of HTML.

Example:

```xml
&lt;p>This is a paragraph.&lt;/p>
```

The angled brackets (`< >`) represent HTML tags; they tell the browser what *kind* of content each bit is. The tags *plus* the content inside of them are HTML *elements*. Almost all elements have an "opening" tag and a "closing" tag. The closing tag has a forward slash (`/`). Remember to close tags in reverse order. 

Example:

```xml
&lt;p&gt;Paragraph with a &lt;a href=&quot;#&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
```
    </section>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
## What are all the elements?

We'd be here all day if we had to go over every single HTML & HTML5 element - there's so many!

[Here's a handy list](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/HTML5/HTML5_element_list). The ones with the little orange "5" beside them are new in HTML5.

More resources:

* [http://www.sitepoint.com/web-foundations/elements/](http://www.sitepoint.com/web-foundations/elements/)
* [http://websitesetup.org/html5-cheat-sheet/](http://websitesetup.org/html5-cheat-sheet/)
* [html-elements.txt](project/examples/html-elements.txt), located in your **projects > examples** folder 

Take a look!
    </section>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
## HTML Element Relationships

Elements have relationships with other elements in the HTML document that follow a family tree-like structure with branches of descendants, siblings, parents and children.

![](framework/img/workshop/dom-tree.png)
    </section>
    
    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
## Parent, Child, Siblings & Indentation

Notice the way that the tags are indented, so that you can easily read the HTML and see what is a child, parent, and sibling of what elements. This will come in handy later, so keep up this way of indenting.

```xml
&lt;body&gt; &lt;!--this body element is a parent to the div element --&gt;
  &lt;div&gt; &lt;!--this div is a child of the body element, and a parent of the p elements--&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am a sibling of the p below me! I am also a child of the div.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am a sibling of the p above me! I am also a child of the div&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
```
    </section>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
## One more thing...HTML Attributes!

Elements can also include **attributes**. There's also lots of attributes, but for today, here's a few you'll need: 

*   `class` - used mostly for styling
*   `id` - used mostly for styling and in-page links
*   `href` - used in the opening anchor tag, it contains a URL for the link
*   `alt` - used as alternate text if the website can't represent the content or a screen reader is being used
*   `src` - meaning source, used mostly for images, gives the url path for the embedded content

[Here's another handy list](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes) of all of them!
    </section>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
##Enough talk, let's code!

Inside of the folder you downloaded today, there are several folders that contain different content. 

```
llc-responsive-design-master
  |-- framework // Contains files needed for slide presentation. Do not edit!
  |-- project // Contains exercise files for today's workshop.
  |-- index.html // This is the file you're viewing right now (slides)!
```

In Sublime Text, let's open [index.html](project/indes.html) in your **project** folder and make some changes.

Open Sublime Text and go to **File > Open**.

![](http://cl.ly/image/103C1W2s2T1H/Image%202015-01-28%20at%209.51.34%20PM.png)

Navigate to the **project** folder (in the folder you downloaded with today's slides). With the entire folder selected, select Open.  

OR go to your Finder/Windows Explorer, click once and drag & drop the folder into Sublime Text.

The folder and included files will appear in Sublime's side bar. Double click on **html-ex1.html** to open it.

##CSS Overview

CSS stands for "Cascading Style Sheets" and is used to style the HTML elements by overriding the default styles or adding new styles.

A CSS document is made up of a bunch of lines of code, or "rules", that keep referring back to the HTML elements in our HTML document. These rules are always made up of a **selector** and one or more **declarations**. Each declaration has a **property** and a **value**.

```css
selector {
  property: value;
}
```

The **selector** specifies which element(s) to apply the styling to. The **declaration** contains what styles to apply. 

```css
h1 {
  color: red;
}
``` 
    </section>

    <section class="slide">
      <h2>CSS Syntax</h2>
<pre><code>div {
  border: 3px solid #333;
  background-color: lightblue;
}
</code></pre>
      <p>Notice that property & values are separated by a <em>colon</em> and each declaration ends in a <em>semi-colon</em>. These are necessary for the browser to understand your styles. The colon and semi-colon are used here a lot like they are in English!</p> 
      <p>Although you could write all the styles on one line, that's hard to read, so always format your CSS rules this way, with each declaration on its own line.</p>
    </section>
    
    <section class="slide">
      <h2>CSS Properties</h2>
      <p>If you thought there were a lot of HTML elements, there are even more CSS properties!</p>

      <h2>Writing CSS - Where Does it Go?</h2>
      <p>You can technically put CSS in one of three places: inline, internal, and in it's own document (linked/external).</p>
      <p>In this class, we're going to skip the first two because they're not good practice anyway, and go straight to making our own CSS documents.</p>
      <p><strong>NOTE:</strong> We've already seen inline styles used in our examples with the "style" attribute, and internal CSS is just CSS rules all together inside the head element, using a style tag.</p>

    <section class="slide">
      <h2>Let's make HTML and CSS documents and link them!</h2>

      <ol>
        <li>First, lets write some content in our HTML document</li>
        <li>Next, we'll write some CSS styles to make it look different</li>

    <p>Classes are used mostly for styling purposes, and can be reused throughout your code</p>
    <p>In the CSS, a class selector starts with a ".", unlike HTML elements</p>
    <p>You can have an unlimited number of classes on each element, but only add them if you absolutely need to.</p>

    <section class="slide">
      <h2>CSS Selectors cont.</h2>
      <p>Let's look at our example five CSS and HTML files again, and try to find each type of selector and the grouping we've just learned about:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Type Selectors</li>
        <li>Descendant Selectors</li>

      <h2>Inheritance</h2>
      <p>If we look at our <strong>css-ex5.css</strong> file again and look at the body selector. It has a font-size and font-family and so on set on it. But our webpage clearly has paragraphs and other elements we could declare a font on. Why is it on body then?</p>
      <p>Remember that CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets? Now we know what they mean by cascading! The browser reads the CSS from the top of the page down, and some of these styles are "inherited" from their parents.</p>

      ##Specificity
      ###What's going on here? Why are there so many "h2"'s?
      ```css
      h2, h3, h4 {
      font-family: "Open Sans", sans-serif;
      font-weight: 400;
      margin: 0;
    }

    h2, h3 {
    text-transform: uppercase;
    }

    h2 {
    font-size: 32px;
    }

    section h2 {
    border-bottom: 1px solid #ccc;
    margin-bottom: 20px;
    }
    ```
    </section>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      ##Specificity cont.
      The most specific OR the most recent CSS rule will be selected. Which one gets selected is based largely on magic.

      GENERAL RULE: the styles for an element that came last in the CSS document will be used, unless overridden by a more "specific" selector. Classes, for example, make things more specific than just a type selector would be.

      Example:
      ```css
      p {
      /*less specific*/
    }

    p.special-paragraph {
    /*more specific*/
    }
    ```

      <p>Step one: the meta viewport tag</p>
      <pre><code>
        &lt;meta name=&quot;viewport&quot; content=&quot;width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0&quot;&gt;
      </code></pre>
      <p>Without this our media queries won't work. It goes inside the head tags in our HTML document. Don't forget it!</p>
      <p>Let's add it in to our final project site now.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="slide">
      <h2>Media Queries cont.</h2>
      <p><strong>What do media queries do?</strong></p>
      <p>They apply CSS to your document only when the viewport has reached a certain size (eg. 1200px)</p>
      <p><strong>What do they look like?</strong></p>
      <pre><code>
        @media (max-width: 1200px) {
        body {
        background-color: purple;
      }
    }
    </code></pre>
    <p>The above says any viewport with a maximum width of 1200px will have a body with a background-color of purple. So any screen 1200px wide or LESS will get the styles inside of this media query.</p> 
    <p>If the viewport is 1201px will the background be purple? What if it's 1199px?</p>
    </section>

    <section class="slide">
      <h2>Media Queries: an Example</h2>
      <p>To see what this looks like, open up <strong>html-ex6.html</strong> and <strong>css-ex6.css</strong></p>
      <p>We'll want to add some media queries in to our CSS to change a few things. Resize the browser window - what breaks?</p>
    </section>

    <section class="slide">
      <h2>Solving our Problems with Media Queries</h2>
      <p>How about this:</p>
      <img src="images/outside-numbers.jpg">
      <p>While there are lots of things we can do to solve this, a easy one is change the text size!</p>
    </section>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      ##Coding Media Queries
      First, let's add some background colours into each media query to help us see where the breakpoints are, like this:

      ```css
      /* Portrait tablet and small desktops */
      @media (max-width: 940px) {
      body {
      background-color: pink;
    }
    }
    ```
    </section>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      ##Coding Media Queries cont.
      Let's try changing the size of the text (.box p) to 3rem, 2.5rem, and then 2rem.

      The first one will look like this:

      ```css
      /* Portrait tablet and small desktops */
      @media (max-width: 940px) {
      body {
      background-color: pink;
    }
    .box p {
    font-size: 3rem;
    }
    }
    ```
    </section>
    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      ##Coding Media Queries cont.
      How about the size of the text in the aside (sidebar) and the big paragraph?

      Lets make them a bit smaller on smaller size screens. 

      How about **1.5rem on the p selector**? Remember why that won't effect the paragraph in the .box div?
    </section>

    <section class="slide">
      <h2>Coding Media Queries cont.</h2>
      <p>Let's try one more, a harder one this time. The aside element looks pretty squished when we resize the browser to a smaller viewport.</p>
      <p>Let's make the element sit on top of the three .box elements</p>
      <p>But...how?</p>
      <ul>
        <li class="delayed">Set the width of the aside to 100%</li>
        <li class="delayed">This works only becuase we've put it before the main block of elements</li>
        <li class="delayed">Set aside p to display:inline-block</li>
        <li class="delayed">What else should we do?</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

      <h2>A Brief Interlude: the Web Inspector</h2>
      <p>We have a handy tool to see our page in specific device sizes, and to help us figure out what elements get what styles from where. It's the Web Inspector!</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Right click anywhere in the browser viewport</li>
        <li>Select <strong>Inspect Element</strong></li>
        <li>Refresh the browser</li>

      <h2>Starting our Final Project!</h2>
      <p>We now know enough to dive into our project for today!</p>
      <p>In our class files we have a folder called <strong>final-project</strong>. Open the <strong>index.html</strong> file in Sublime and in your browser - where are all the styles? Why does it still look like the default styling?</p>
    </section>

    <section class="slide">
      <h2>Starting our Final Project</h2>
      <p>We're starting with a nice fluid design, where most of the content is centered. This means we're already ahead of the game. </p>
      <p>Let's find some things we've learned throughout the code in this website:</p>
      <ul>
        <li class="delayed">Nesting HTML elements</li>
        <li class="delayed">Attributes, including class attributes</li>
        <li class="delayed">CSS rule syntax: selector, declaration (property + value)</li>
        <li class="delayed">CSS selectors: type, class, descendant. Grouping them together.</li>
        <li class="delayed">Inheritence and Specificity</li>
        <li class="delayed">Percentage-based fluid layout (eg. see .content-wrap)</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="slide">
      <h2>What can we Improve?</h2>
      <p>We'll target a few main things that are always important to keep in mind when doing responsive design.</p>
      <ul>
        <li class="delayed">Hide fixed elements on smaller screens</li>
        <li class="delayed">Margin, padding and text sizing on header and circle elements</li>
        <li class="delayed">Image size and positioning</li>
        <li class="delayed">:hover effects and similar things to think about</li>
        <li class="delayed">Centering all the things, spacing/whitespace</li>
        <li class="delayed">Navigation!</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      ##Hiding Elements
      Don't make this a habit: it's convenient but the browser still needs to load this code, and that slows your site down. Use it sparingly!

      ```css
      @media (max-width: somewidthpx) {
      somediv {
      display: none;
    }
    }
    ```
    That's it! If we look at our site as a small phone in the emulator we can see the "download pdf" button takes up too much screen real estate - let's hide it on our smallest screens.
    </section>

    <section class="slide">
      <h2>Typography</h2>
      <p>We could have an entire class on web typography alone.</p>
      <p><strong>Margin, padding, line-height, text-size, and font-family.</strong></p>
      <p>These are all extremely important in responsive design - keep your text limited and meaningful, use one to two readable fonts, and make sure text is a good size for all screen sizes.</p>
      <p>Typography on a responsive site should be: readable, efficient, and responsive itself. How do we accomplish this?</p>
    </section>

    <section class="slide">
      <h2>Responsive Type: Rems and Ems Versus Pixels</h2>
      <ul>
        <li class="delayed"><strong>px:</strong> pixels, not responsive. Boo.</li>
        <li class="delayed"><strong>em:</strong> size is relative to the type size of the parent element. Eg. if parent element is 14px and child element is 1em, child element is 14px. If child element is 0.5em child element is 7px</li>
        <li class="delayed"><strong>rem:</strong> root ems - like ems but relative ONLY to the root element (html element)</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="delayed">This can be very confusing. Here's a great way to approach it: <a href="http://css-tricks.com/rems-ems/" alt="css tricks rems versus ems article">http://css-tricks.com/rems-ems</a></p>
      <p class="delayed">When in doubt, just use rems, and set font-size on your html element (default usually 16px).</p>
    </section>
    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      ##Making our Web Copy Responsive
      Let's go through our final project CSS and change some of the font-sizes to rems.

      Since the root font-size is 16px, just divide the pixel size in the CSS by 16. 

      Example:

      ```css
      h1 {
      font-family: "Pacifico", cursive;
      font-size: 5rem; /*used to be 80px*/
      font-weight: 400;
      margin: 0;
    }
    ```
    </section>

    <section class="slide">
      <h2>Margin and Padding</h2>
      <p>From the 768px media query down, the circles in the Skills section don't look great. We can change this by adjusting our <strong>margin</strong> and <strong>padding</strong> values.</p>
      <ol>
        <li class="delayed">First, let's use the web inspector to find out what classes/elements we need to target</li>
        <li class="delayed">Next, we'll go to our CSS and target that class in our 768px media query</li>
        <li class="delayed">We want to space the circles out a bit more, so let's add a margin to the elements</li>
      </ol>
    </section>

    <section class="slide">
      <h2>Resizing Elements</h2>
      <p>You might notice that at our 480px media query the circles are in one long line. They're taking up too much room! Scrolling is boring, so let's make these a bit smaller.</p>
      <p>Again, target the element in the media query. Then change the height, width, margin, and line-height properties.</p>
      <p>Oh no! the font size is too big too, let's change that! Notice how we don't have to include the margin value from the last query - remember styles inherit/cascade!</p>
    </section>

    <section class="slide">
      <h2>Profile Image</h2>
      <p>Our profile image gets really small at smaller screens. It also takes up a lot of room from 480px. What should we do with it?</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Make it a bit smaller by changing width to 60%</li>
        <li>set the display property to the value "block"</li>
        <li>set margin to 0 auto, the magical centering declaration for block elements</li>
        <li>Set float to "none", as it was float:left before</li>
        <li>Go back to margin and actually set it to     margin:0 auto 4rem; to put some space on the bottom</li>
      </ol>
    </section>
    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      ##Centering Text, Removing Floats

      The content under our profile picture doesn't look so hot on our smallest screen. Centering content is a simple, common way of getting some white space on a cramped mobile screen.

      Try this out on our 480px media query:

      ```css
      .profile .summary {
      text-align: center;
      float: none;
      width: 100%; /*notice we still have padding from the code above*/
    }
    ```

      <h2>A Note on Navigation</h2>
      <p>So far we're using the "do nothing approach" and for our site, it's ok</p>

    <section class="slide">
      <h2>Final Notes</h2>
      <p>Responsive is an iterative process. Don't get discouraged if every time you look back at your site, something needs to be changed! Websites are never "done", even the best can always be improved.</p>
      <p>When in doubt:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Center content (but keep it readable and large enough on small screens)</li>
        <li>Don't use fixed elements, hover effects, etc. as necessary parts of the functionality of your site</li>
        <li>Think about <strong>HOW</strong> your user will be using your site: mobile's different!</li>
        <li>Keep it simple! Less words, utilize white space</li>
        <li>Remember your site will never look pixel perfect on 100% of viewport sizes</li>
      </ul>
