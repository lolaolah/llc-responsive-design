      ##Getting Set Up

      **[Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com)** - a text editor with colour highlighting and other helpful features. If you are unable to install Sublime Text, try installing: [Notepad++](http://notepad-plus-plus.org/) (Windows), [Atom](https://atom.io/) (Mac) or [Text Wrangler](http://www.barebones.com/products/textwrangler/download.html) (older Macs).

      **[Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/intl/en-CA/chrome/browser/)** - Choose a modern web browser that supports current web standards and has good development tools. 

      To set Chrome as your default browser, follow [these instructions](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95417?hl=en). 

      Firefox, Safari, and IE 10+ are great, but their dev tools are different so stick to Chrome for this class please! Visit [browsehappy.com](http://browsehappy.com) for more info about modern browsers.
    </section>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      ##Chrome Dev Tools

      **Developer tools** allow us to *inspect* any web page to see the code. It also includes a *mobile device emulator*! The tools can be accessed in 3 ways:

      * right-click / two-finger tap on a web page and select **Inspect Element** OR
      * select the menu icon in the top right hand corner of the Chrome browser and select **Tools > Developer Tools** OR
      * keyboard shortcut: **Ctrl + Shift + I** (PC) / **Cmnd + Option + I** (Mac)

      Features are always being added/updated so make sure you're up to date by copying `chrome://chrome/` into your browser address bar.

      Open dev tools. Ensure the little phone is blue to start the emulator!

      <h1>What is <br> Responsive Design?</h1>
    </section>

    <section class="slide">
      <h2>Different types of web design</h2>
      <p>Flexible websites are not at totally new concepts so in order to understand responsive web design and development better, we have to understand what the options are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Fixed</li>
        <li>Fluid</li>
        <li>Adaptive</li>
        <li>Responsive</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
##Fixed Web Design

*   Everything has a set width (eg. 960px). Popular method before mobile browsing became commonplace.
*   On a mobile screen, it is zoomed out to the size of the device making the content really small. 
*   Will need a separate site, usually an "m dot" site to make something mobile friendly :(

Try opening these sites on your phone or resize the browser:  

[toronto.ca](http://toronto.ca)  
[m.facebook.com](https://m.facebook.com/)  
[facebook.com](https://facebook.com)
    </section>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
##Fluid web design
*   Based on percentage widths, each block of content takes up a percentage of the page. (e.g. a sidebar with a width of 30% and main section with a width of ~70%)
*   When you resize the browser, the blocks will resize *relative* to the size of the page (aka the "viewport").
*   Not optimized for smaller screens & mobile devices.

Example: [http://alistapart.com/d/responsive-web-design/ex/ex-site-flexible.html](http://alistapart.com/d/responsive-web-design/ex/ex-site-flexible.html)

[Full article here](http://alistapart.com/article/responsive-web-design). Also, the article that started the Responsive Design movement.
    </section>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
## Adaptive web design

*   Uses a series of fixed layouts.
*   Uses _media queries_ to target specific viewport sizes (more on this later).
*   The content itself changes.
*   Best to think of it as a _set_ of fixed layouts that are invoked in response to the device size.

Example: [goo.gl/lUyNrZ](http://goo.gl/lUyNrZ)
    </section>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      ## And finally...responsive web design!

*   Uses a fluid grid layout.
*   Unlike fluid designs, it _also_ uses media queries to change the look and feel depending on device size.
*   Page components are **flexible** in between common device sizes and designed with **breakpoints** to present content in the most suitable way for common device sizes.
*   Can keep content layout similar and/or move/hide content.

Example: [goo.gl/JNfJ5X](http://goo.gl/JNfJ5X)

What do you notice about the changing layout?

      <blockquote>"When you lose 80% of your screen real estate, all the extraneous bloat that tends to finds its way onto large screen designs doesn’t seem so attractive or necessary anymore. Mobile provides a great opportunity to reevaluate what content/functionality is necessary and gives us an opportunity to strip away the cruft across the board (and not just for mobile users either). These constraints also encourage ease-of-use, intuitiveness and speed as essential ingredients to a good user experience."

      <h1>Crash Course in HTML</h1>
    </section>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
## HTML Overview / Review

HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is used to wrap the contents and assign meaning to parts of your web document using **tags** to create HTML **elements**. HTML5 is the latest version of HTML.

Example:

```xml
&lt;p>This is a paragraph.&lt;/p>
```

The angled brackets (`< >`) represent HTML tags; they tell the browser what *kind* of content each bit is. The tags *plus* the content inside of them are HTML *elements*. Almost all elements have an "opening" tag and a "closing" tag. The closing tag has a forward slash (`/`). Remember to close tags in reverse order. 

Example:

```xml
&lt;p&gt;Paragraph with a &lt;a href=&quot;#&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
```
    </section>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
## What are all the elements?

We'd be here all day if we had to go over every single HTML & HTML5 element - there's so many!

[Here's a handy list](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/HTML5/HTML5_element_list). The ones with the little orange "5" beside them are new in HTML5.

More resources:

* [http://www.sitepoint.com/web-foundations/elements/](http://www.sitepoint.com/web-foundations/elements/)
* [http://websitesetup.org/html5-cheat-sheet/](http://websitesetup.org/html5-cheat-sheet/)
* [html-elements.txt](project/html-elements.txt), located in your **project** folder 

Let's go over some commonly used tags.
    </section>
    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
##HTML: Commonly used tags

**Title**: Found in the `&lt;head>` section of the HTML document. Used for defining the page title. Displays in the browser's tab, search engine results and bookmarks.

```xml
&lt;title&gt;Page Title&lt;/title&gt;
```

**Headings**: There are 6 heading tags available (`&lt;h1&gt;,&lt;h2&gt;,...,&lt;h6&gt;`) and follow a hierarchical structure. It's important to use the appropriate tag to describe the content, not for the default heading styles. That's what CSS is for!

```xml
&lt;h1&gt;Most Important Heading&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Second Most Important Heading&lt;/h2&gt;
```

**Paragraphs**: Created with the `&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;` tags.
```xml
&lt;p&gt;I'm a paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;
```

**Link**: requires the addition of an `href` *attribute* (more on this later) to specify where to link to.

```
&lt;a href=&quot;http://website.com&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;
```

**Lists**: There are two kinds of lists: ordered (`ol`) for numbered lists & undordered (`ul`) for lists with bullets. Content must be included only within the list item (`li`).

```xml
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Unordered list item&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Unordered list item&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Ordered list item&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Ordered list item&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
```
**Images**: like links, also requires the an additional attribute, `src`, for linking to the image file.

```
&lt;img src=&quot;path/to/image.jpg&quot;&gt;    ```
    </section>
    
    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
##HTML vs HTML5

HTML5 is the latest *version* of HTML.  This latest version includes better browser support for  multimedia and graphical content like `video`, `audio` and `canvas` elements.

HTML5 also introduced a number of *semantic* tags that better describe blocks of content. Prior to this latest version, the `&lt;div>` tag was used for grouping elements. While it is still valid, HTML5 introduced a number of semantic tags that better describe blocks of content. You'll see some in **index.html** provided in today's project.  

Here's a great resource to learn more about HTML5: http://html5doctor.com/   
    </section>
    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
## HTML Element Relationships

Elements have relationships with other elements in the HTML document that follow a family tree-like structure with branches of descendants, siblings, parents and children.

![](framework/img/workshop/dom-tree.png)
    </section>
    
    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
## Parent, Child, Siblings & Indentation

Notice the way that the tags are indented, so that you can easily read the HTML and see what is a child, parent, and sibling of what elements. This will come in handy later, so keep up this way of indenting.

```xml
&lt;body&gt; &lt;!--this body element is a parent to the div element --&gt;
  &lt;div&gt; &lt;!--this div is a child of the body element, and a parent of the p elements--&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am a sibling of the p below me! I am also a child of the div.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am a sibling of the p above me! I am also a child of the div&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
```
    </section>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
## One more thing...HTML Attributes!

Elements can also include **attributes**. There's also lots of attributes, but for today, here's a few you'll need: 

*   `class` - used mostly for styling
*   `id` - used mostly for styling and in-page links
*   `href` - used in the opening anchor tag, it contains a URL for the link
*   `alt` - used as alternate text if the website can't represent the content or a screen reader is being used
*   `src` - meaning source, used mostly for images, gives the url path for the embedded content

[Here's another handy list](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes) of all of them!
    </section>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
##Enough talk, let's code!

Inside of the folder you downloaded today, there are several folders that contain different content. 

```
llc-responsive-design-master
  |-- framework // Contains files needed for slide presentation. Do not edit!
  |-- project // Contains exercise files for this workshop.
  |-- index.html // This is the file you're viewing right now (slides)!
```

In Sublime Text, let's open [index.html](project/index.html) in your **project** folder and make some changes.

Open Sublime Text and go to **File > Open**.

![](http://cl.ly/image/103C1W2s2T1H/Image%202015-01-28%20at%209.51.34%20PM.png)

Then, navigate to the **project** folder (in the folder you downloaded with today's slides). With the entire folder selected, click **Open**.  

**OR** go to your Finder/Windows Explorer, click once and drag & drop the folder into Sublime Text.

The folder and included files will appear in Sublime's side bar. Double click on **index.html** to open it.

##CSS Overview

CSS stands for "Cascading Style Sheets" and is used to style the HTML elements by overriding the default styles or adding new styles.

A CSS document is made up of a bunch of lines of code, or "rules", that keep referring back to the HTML elements in our HTML document. These rules are always made up of a **selector** and one or more **declarations**. Each declaration has a **property** and a **value**.

```css
selector {
  property: value;
}
```

The **selector** specifies which element(s) to apply the styling to. The **declaration** contains what styles to apply. 

```css
h1 {
  color: red;
}
``` 
    </section>

    <section class="slide">
      <h2>CSS Syntax</h2>
<pre><code>div {
  border: 3px solid #333;
  background-color: lightblue;
}
</code></pre>
      <p>Notice that property & values are separated by a <em>colon</em> and each declaration ends in a <em>semi-colon</em>. These are necessary for the browser to understand your styles. The colon and semi-colon are used here a lot like they are in English!</p> 
      <p>Although you could write all the styles on one line, that's hard to read, so always format your CSS rules this way, with each declaration on its own line.</p>

##Writing CSS - Where Does it Go?

You can add CSS to your web page in many ways. Today we're going to put the CSS in it's own document, in a linked/external style sheet. This method is recommended because it separates the CSS from the HTML document and can be referenced on any HTML page where the styles need to be included.

Referenced in the `&lt;head>` element with a `&lt;link&gt;` tag and two **attributes**, `rel` and `href`. Just like creating links, the value of the `href` points to the location of the style sheet. Though it is not required, css files are often saved in a css folder for organization, so make sure the file path points to the appropriate directory.


```
&lt;head&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;Page Title&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;meta charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;
    &lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; href=&quot;css/style.css&quot;&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
```

**Pro tip!**  Sublime Text shortcut: type "link" + tab key. Ta da!
    </section>
    
    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
##Class exercise

For today's final project, we are going to take a web page that is already styled but not mobile friendly or optimized for different screen sizes.  

Go back to Sublime and **index.html**.  We're going to link the existing CSS file, **styles.css** to and see what happens!  The styles are there but try resizing the browser.  What happens?
  
Before we go into responsive design techniques, let's go over & review some fundamental concepts first so we can make sense of the existing CSS provided in today's project.
    </section>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
## First up: the class attribute!

Classes are used mostly for styling and can be reused throughout your code.  Name the class anything you want! To use it, include it in the *opening* tag. You can have an unlimited number of classes on each element, but only add them if you absolutely need to.

```xml
&lt;div class="message">&lt;/div>
&lt;div class="message warning">&lt;/div>

```

In the CSS, a class selector starts with a leading period, unlike HTML element selectors. (More on this soon.)

```
.warning {
  background-color: red;
}
```

Let's look at the **index.html** and **styles.css** files for examples.
    </section>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
##Type & Descendant Selectors

Type selectors select HTML elements by using the tag name.

```css
div {
  /*styles for all divs on the page*/
}
a {
  /*styles for all links on the page*/  
}
```

Descendant selectors target any child/descendant elements.  Note the space *in between* the element names.

```css
div p {
  /*all paragraphs that are descendants of any divs*/
}

ul li a {
  /*links inside of list items, inside of unordered lists. 
  Question: will this affect links inside of ordered lists (ol's)?*/
}
```
    </section>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
##Class Selectors

Selects elements based on class names.  Can be combined with other classes or type selectors.

```css
.container {
  /*styles for all elements with a class of container, no matter what element type*/
}
p.container {
  /* styles for all paragraph elements with a class of "container" - matches type & class */
}
.container.warning {
  /* styles for all elements with BOTH a class of container and warning */
}
.container .warning {
  /* how is this different from the one above? */
}
p.container a {
  /* guess what this one does! */
}

```
    </section>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
##Combining selectors
Sometimes you'll have several elements that share the same styles.  You can *combine* the selectors.

```css
h1, h2, h3 {
  /*all h1, h2, and h3's*/
}

p, a {
  /*what will this one select?*/
}

.warning, a, p.cats {
  /*what will this one select?*/
}
```
    </section>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
## CSS Selectors

Let's go back to **styles.css** and try to find each type of selector and combinations we've just learned about:

*   Type Selectors
*   Descendant Selectors
*   Class Selectors
*   Combined Selectors
    </section>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
## Inheritance

In the **styles.css** file, the body selector contains a `font-family` property. 

```css
body {
  font-family: "Merriweather", serif;
  ...
}
```
Why is it declared here?

Remember, CSS stands for *Cascading* Style Sheets. The browser reads the CSS from *top to bottom* (or cascades) and some of these styles are inherited from their parent elements. This makes it more efficient than declaring this same styles over and over again for each element.
    </section>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
##Specificity

What's going on here? Why are there so many `h2`'s?

```css
h2, h3, h4 {
  font-family: "Open Sans", sans-serif;
  font-weight: 400;
  margin: 0;
}
h2, h3 {
  text-transform: uppercase;
}
h2 {
  font-size: 32px;
}
section h2 {
  border-bottom: 1px solid #ccc;
  margin-bottom: 20px;
}
```
    </section>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
##Specificity cont.
The most specific selector OR the most recent CSS rule will be selected and rendered into the browser. Which one gets selected is based largely on magic.

GENERAL RULE: the styles for an element that came last in the CSS document will be used, *unless* overridden by a more *specific* selector. Classes, for example, are more specific than a type selector.

```css
p {
/* all paragraphs - less specific */
}

p.special-paragraph {
/* only paragraphs with this class - more specific */
}
```
    </section>
<section class="slide" data-markdown>
##What is this?

You will see this little snippet at the top of your CSS file. But what does it do?

```css
*, *:before, *:after {
  box-sizing: border-box;
}
```
    </section>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
##The Box Model

Margins, padding, widths, and borders, oh my: the glorious box model.

![](framework/img/workshop/box-model.png)

This snippet is the fix for the way the box model handles the sizing of elements.

```css
*, *:before, *:after {
  box-sizing: border-box;
}
```

##Percentages and CSS3 Media Queries

A fluid layout using percentages + media queries = responsive design

Let's see what happens when the CSS is not fluid. Larger resolution looks great:

![](http://cl.ly/image/0G3l1q3E0n2M/Image%202015-01-29%20at%2011.55.08%20PM.png)

Smaller resolutions, not so good:

![](http://cl.ly/image/3c2y1v2A2o1q/Image%202015-01-29%20at%2011.55.36%20PM.png)

On the phone, it's even worse! (Screen shot from Chrome's emulator dev tool - more on this later.)

![](http://cl.ly/image/1u0r0i0z0w1L/Image%202015-01-30%20at%2012.03.46%20AM.png)
    </section>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
##Percentages first, then media queries

In **styles.css**, look for this code block.  It should be around line 79.  Notice that the width is set to a fixed width of 1000px.  

```css
.content-wrap {
  width: 1000px;
  margin: 0 auto;
  padding: 90px 0; 
}
```

That means no matter what, that container will always be 1000px.  

Let's change it to `max-width: 1000px;` and also add `width: 80%;` and see how that changes the page.

**Pro tip!** In Sublime, select **Find > Find...**  OR Control/Command F -- this will open a bar at the bottom of the screen.  Type in **.content-wrap** and select Find.  This will make it easier to search for code snippets.
    </section>

    <section class="slide side-by-side" data-markdown>
##Fluid is not the same as responsive

It works much better now, the content is scaled relative to the size of the browser.

![](http://cl.ly/image/3c2y1v2A2o1q/Image%202015-01-29%20at%2011.55.36%20PM.png)
![](http://cl.ly/image/3Z3U023P361J/Image%202015-01-30%20at%2012.37.27%20AM.png)

But sometimes, when you get to a smaller size, you might want to make changes that go beyond just scaling up/down the width of the page components. 
    </section>

    <section class="slide side-by-side" data-markdown>
##What if we did something like this?

This is an example of a responsive change. The CSS has *changed* based on a screen size. 

![](http://cl.ly/image/3Z3U023P361J/Image%202015-01-30%20at%2012.37.27%20AM.png)
![](http://cl.ly/image/03403z392120/Screen%20Shot%202015-01-30%20at%2012.33.31%20AM.png)
    </section>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
##Media Queries

Media queries are the key to making a responsive website because it allows you to apply CSS to your document *only* when the screen has reach a certain size. Lets take a look at a basic media query.

```css
@media (max-width: 940px) {
  body {
    background: red;
  }
}
```
In the above we target all [media types](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media) and the max-width of 940px. Anything *equal* or *less than* 940px wide will apply this CSS.

Notice how the CSS is nested inside of what looks like another CSS rule? You can have multiple CSS declaration blocks in one media query.

```css
@media (max-width: 940px) {
  body {
    background: red;
  }
  h2 {
    font-size: 20px;
  }
}
```

The above CSS gets applied when the browser reaches a width of 940px or smaller. This is referred to as a **breakpoint**.
    </section>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
##Media Queries and Width

The most common way to use media queries is by targeting the width of a device.

The previous example had a `max-width` declared meaning that any styles in that media query will only apply to a screen that is equal to or smaller than the max-width. You can also use `min-width` to target screen sizes that are equal to or *larger* than the min-width.  This is useful when using a mobile-first approach to designing.

```css
@media (min-width: 400px) {
  ...
}
```

You can also specify a range by combining min-width and max-width. This will only be applied when the width of your browser is greater or equal to 768px and less or equal to 940px.

```css
@media (min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 940px) { 
    ...     
}
```
    </section>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
##Media Queries and Heights

Heights can be targeting in the same way as widths are using min-height or max-height.

```css
@media (min-height: 568px) {
    /* anything as high or higher than the iPhone 5 */
}
```

You can also mix height and width in the same media query:

```css
@media (min-height: 568px) and (min-width:320px) {
    ...
}
```

**Note**: Height-based media queries can be tricky. For example, browser bars may take up different heights and most of the time, you want your content to just flow as long as it needs to be. 
    </section>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
##Class Exercise: Media Queries!

Let's add our first media query!  Adding a noticeable change like a background colour into each media query can help us to see easily where our breakpoints are, like this:

```css
@media (max-width: 1000px) {

  body {
    background-color: lightblue;
  }  
}
```

In today's project, we have an image set as the background so in this specific instance, this trick might not be as easy to see.  Let's try changing the font colour instead.

```css
@media (max-width: 1000px) {

  body {
    color: lightblue;
  }  
}
```

Where to add the media queries? Personal preference.
Some people like to create a separate style sheet just for media queries, others like to group it with the CSS section it's being applied to (e.g. responsive header changes are added directly under the base header styles).

For today, let's just group all of our media queries at the bottom of the style sheet.
    </section>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
##Common breakpoints

There are many different device sizes so trying to target a specific device is tricky.  It's best to combine fluid techniques *with* media queries so the design is still flexible in between common breakpoints. Here are some to consider:

320px — Mobile portrait  
480px — Mobile landscape  
600px — Small tablet  
768px — Tablet portrait  
940px - 1024px — Tablet landscape, small desktop  
1280px & greater — Desktop  

These are just general guidelines. Add media queries to optimize for desktop/laptops, tablets and mobile phones. Use fluid techniques wherever possible, then add a breakpoint when the design breaks and is no longer suitable that viewport.

On the other hand, be careful about using too many breakpoints. If you find that you have two media queries that are close, see if you can move the styles to one or the other instead of creating another breakpoint.
    </section>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
##Exercise (15 mins)

Using the general breakpoint guidelines and the first media query example, add two more media queries to target tablet and mobile.  

Don't forget to test it!

(See the next slide for the answer but only if you're really stuck!)

**Bonus exercise**:    
Change your accent colour! Using Chrome's dev tools, *inspect* any element that has a colour, try the "Hello" background or a link, to see if you can figure out where the blue CSS color is coming from and change it to your own colour choice.

Here's a great resource for colours: http://colours.neilorangepeel.com/

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
## Exercise Solution

These are just general suggestions, you may find that you'll need to adjust these sizes as you start to make changes to your page design & layout. Let's discuss what breakpoints you all chose to use.
```css     
/* MEDIA QUERIES

@media (max-width: 1000px) {
  body {
    color: lightblue;
  }
}

@media (max-width: 800px) {
  body {
    color: blue;
  }
}

@media (max-width: 600px) {
  body {
    color: red;
  }
}
```

## A Brief Interlude: the Web Inspector

We have a handy tool to see our page in specific device sizes, and to help us figure out what elements get what styles from where. It's the Web Inspector!

*   Right click anywhere in the browser viewport
*   Select **Inspect Element**
*   Make sure the little phone is blue to start the emulator and click it again to turn it off.
*   Refresh the browser

##Don't Forget the Viewport Meta Tag!

The viewport meta tag **must** be included in the <head> of your HTML document to ensure that the page responds on mobile devices. This tag tells browsers (primarily mobile browsers) how to size itself.

```xml
&lt;meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
```

* `meta` is the tag name and goes in the `&lt;head` of the web page.
* `name="viewport"` use viewport to tell the browser sizing information.
* `content` provides info about how to size the viewport. Multiple `key=value` are comma separated.
* `width=device-width` tells the browser to be as wide as the device.
* `initial-scale` is the zoom value at which the site is zoomed in/out by default. A value of 1.0 will render the size without any zoom.
* `user-scalable=no` (not shown in example), will limit users from being able to zoom into your website.
* `minimum-scale` & `maximum-scale` will limit how far in or out a user can scale/zoom into the website.

In the Chrome emulator, see how the layout changes once the viewport meta tag is added.

##Class Exercise

Let's figure out what we need to change to get it to look like this:

![](http://cl.ly/image/03403z392120/Screen%20Shot%202015-01-30%20at%2012.33.31%20AM.png)

1. What breakpoint should we make this change at?
1. Move the image to the right side.
1. Adjust the width of the image and content area.

This means we have to override the current CSS.  To override it, we need to use the same selector or a more specific selector.  Using the Chrome dev tools will make it easier to figure out rather than just looking at the CSS files.  Let's open it now, look for the selectors to target and test out some CSS changes.
    </section>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
##Exercise (15mins) - Updating the About section

After looking through the dev tools, we've determine where and what changes to make.  

1. Breakpoint should be around 768px - 900px-ish (You decide what looks good.)
1. The classes that should be targeted are `.profile-image` and `.profile .summary`
1. For `.profile-image`, these are the values that need to change:
```
float: left;
width: 27%;
margin-right: 3%;
```
  * adjust these values to make it float to the right as well as increase the profile image width.
1. For `.profile .summary`, these are the values that need to change:
```
float: left;
width: 70%;
```
  * adjust these values to reflect the width changes in the profile image and remove the float so the text wraps the image.

Hints: 

* Make sure your width percentages equals 100%, including margin!
* Since you can't delete CSS with media queries, use the value of `none` to reset a float.

(A sample answer is on the next slide.)
    </section>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
Your CSS should be similar to the below snippet. Your width values may vary depending on what you decide looks best to you.

```
@media (max-width: 825px) {
  /* this is here just for testing */
  body {
    color: blue;
  }
  
  /* About section */
  .profile-image {
    width: 48%;
    float: right;
    margin: 0 0 15px 2%;
  }
  .profile .summary {
    width: auto; /* resets the width setting */
    /* or could also use width: 50% - if you don't want the text to wrap */
    float: none; /* removes the float */
  }
}
```
    </section>
    
    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      ##What else can we change?

      The **Work Experience** section looks fine at this breakpoint but once we start going smaller, it starts to get squished.  So let's go back to the Chrome dev tools and see what to adjust here.

      Perhaps changing it from two columns, side by side, to stacking the content on top of each other will do the trick.  Let's check it out! 

      Heads up: making responsive changes requires a lot of tweaking and testing and inspecting elements.  Be prepared to do a lot of experimenting!
    </section>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
##Exercise (15mins) - Updating Work Experience 

After looking at the Work Experience section, we've determined where the changes need to be made. The below snippet is the base CSS.  To get rid of the floated two columns styles, reset the float (hint: use `none`), adjust the width to span all the way across and remove/update any padding & margin to your liking.

```css
.work-experience .details {
  float: left;
  width: 30%;
  padding-right: 30px;
}
.work-experience .description {
  font-size: 14px;
  width: 70%;
  float: right;
  margin-top: 5px;
}
```
**Pro tip!** Only use the properties that need to be changed.  For example, if the font-size doesn't need to be change, no need to add it to the media query.

Sample CSS on the next slide.
    </section>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>

Sample solution for the previous slide's exercise. This should be included inside of the appropriate media query.

```css
.work-experience .details {
  float: none; /* removed float */
  width: 100%; /* auto will work as well */
  padding-right: 0px; /* don't need padding anymore now that it spans across the page */
}
.work-experience .description {
  width: 100%;
  float: none; /* removed float */
}
```

      <p class="delayed">When in doubt, use rems, and set a base font-size on your html element. The default is equivalent to 16px, but you can set it to anything you want.</p>
    </section>
    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
##Making font sizes responsive

How do we calculate rems?  If you want the font-size to be equivalent to 80px, then divide it by the base font-size to get the rem value.

80 / 16 = 5rem

If you want simpler math, set your base font-size to either 62.5% or 10px.

Now, 1rem = 10px, 1.1rem = 11px, 2.4rem = 24px, etc.

Let's update just the font-size for h1 and h2 to rems.

```css
html {
  font-size: 62.5%; /* sets base font size to be equal to 10px */
}
h1 {
  font-family: "Pacifico", cursive;
  font-size: 8rem; /* 80px */
  font-weight: 400;
  margin: 0;
}
h2 {
  font-size: 3.2rem; /* 32px */
}
```

**Pro tip!** Using percent-based & relative measurements can give you finer control because you can use decimals with pixels.
    </section>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
##How does this make it responsive?

Let's go back to the browser and look our header text. When we hit our 600px breakpoint, we can make the text smaller to fit the viewport better.  Pixels are fixed units, so to make this change we would have to override both heading values.  Something like this:

```css
h1 {
  font-size: 80px;
}
h2 {
  font-size: 32px;
}

@media (max-width: 600px) {
  h1 {
    font-size: 60px;
  }
  h2 {
    font-size: 22px;
  }
}
```

With relative units, we can just adjust the base font size.  Any fonts declared in pixels will not be affected by this change.  That can be useful for when you want the size to always remain fixed.

```css
html {
  font-size: 62.5%;
}
h1 {
  font-size: 8rem;
}
h2 {
  font-size: 3.2rem;
}

@media (max-width: 600px) {
  html {
    font-size: 40%;
  }
}
```

Let's add this update and see how it affects our page.
    </section>
    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
##rem & px

In the previous example, changing the root font size (`html`) made all of the relative units size accordingly, but you can still use pixels for the styles that need to be at a fixed size and not relative.  For example, you may just want your headings to get smaller but the paragraphs remain the same.

```css
html {
  font-size: 62.5%;
}
h1 {
  font-size: 8rem;
}
h2 {
  font-size: 3.2rem;
}
p {
  font-size: 16px; /* will not change sizes */
}

@media (max-width: 600px) {
  html {
    font-size: 40%;
  }
}
```
    </section>
    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
##Hiding Elements
Here's how to do it, but don't make this a habit. It's convenient but the browser still needs to load this code, and that slows your site down. Use it sparingly!

```css
@media (max-width: somewidthpx) {
  selector {
    display: none;
  }
}
```
That's it!

      <h2>Final Notes</h2>
      <p>Responsive is an iterative process. Don't get discouraged if every time you look back at your site, something needs to be changed! Websites are never "done", even the best can always be improved.</p>
      <p>When in doubt:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Avoid fixed elements, hover effects, etc. as necessary parts of the functionality of your site</li>
        <li>Think about <strong>HOW</strong> your user will be using your site: mobile's different!</li>
        <li>Keep it simple! Less words, utilize white space</li>
        <li>Remember your site will never look pixel perfect on 100% of viewport sizes</li>
